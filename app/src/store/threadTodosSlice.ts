/**
 * The LIVE thread-level todo list, driven by the core's `thread_todos_changed`
 * socket event (and the `openhuman.threads_todos_get` RPC on thread open /
 * reconnect) — not by scraping the deprecated `todo` tool-result payload out
 * of the timeline (see the old `harnessState.ts`, which this replaces).
 *
 * Kept as its own small slice rather than folded into `chatRuntimeSlice`
 * (which already owns the tool timeline, approvals, and plan review) because
 * this state has an entirely different source of truth: a dedicated core
 * event/RPC pair, not tool-call bookkeeping.
