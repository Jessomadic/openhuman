/**
 * Follow-up suggestions per thread: the chips offered under a settled turn.
 *
 * Filled by the core's `chat_suggestions` socket event (`web_chat/suggestions.rs`),
 * which arrives after `chat_done` for a normal single-user turn. Best effort:
 * a thread with no entry just shows no follow-up chips.
 *
 * Holds only the set for the thread's latest turn. It is cleared whenever that
 * turn stops being the latest one: a send starts (`beginInferenceTurn`), the
 * core starts a turn this client did not send, such as an edit, a regenerate
 * or a queued follow-up (`markInferenceTurnStreaming`, driven by
 * `inference_start`), or the transcript tail is cut (`truncateMessagesFrom`).
 *
 * Only `useOpenHumanExternalStore` reads this, and only after a settled turn.
 * See `useWelcomeSuggestions` / `useFollowupSuggestions` there for why the
 * welcome and follow-up chips must never show together.
