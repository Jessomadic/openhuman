/**
 * Coalesce streamed text/thinking deltas into at most one store update per
 * animation frame.
 *
 * Every socket delta used to be its own Redux dispatch, and every dispatch
 * re-projected and re-rendered the live assistant tail — a token rate well
 * above the display's frame rate spent most of that work on frames nobody saw,
 * and that backlog is what the stream stuttered on. A frame is the natural
 * unit: nothing is painted between two of them anyway.
 *
 * ## Ordering is preserved, not traded away
 *
 * - Only ADJACENT deltas for the same `(thread, request, round, channel)` are
 *   merged. A delta for a different key closes the current run, so interleaved
 *   thinking and content — or two threads streaming at once — replay in the
 *   exact order they arrived.
 * - Every other chat event must call {@link ChatDeltaCoalescer.flush} before it
 *   is handled. A `tool_call` therefore always lands after the text that
 *   preceded it, which is the order the transcript records (and the order the
 *   parts render in).
 *
 * ## Redelivery is filtered before merging, not after
 *
 * The socket redelivers frames, and the provider drops a delta whose `seq` it
 * has already applied. That check has to see every frame on its own: once two
 * deltas are merged, a redelivered one inside the same frame is already part
 * of the text. So the filter ({@link CoalesceOptions.accept}) runs at push
 * time, and a merged delta carries its LAST frame's fields (its `seq`), which
 * is the one a later redelivery must compare against.
