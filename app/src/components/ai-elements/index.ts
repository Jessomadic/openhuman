/**
 * The AI-elements layer — chat-surface components adapted from
 * vercel/ai-elements (Apache-2.0) onto this app's own primitives and tokens.
 *
 * Same rule as `components/ui`: if a component exists here, import it from
 * `components/ai-elements` rather than reaching into the file. These are
 * compound components — a root plus its slots — so each family is exported as
 * a group.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY. The port originally landed ten families. Eight of
 * them — Artifact, ChainOfThought, Confirmation, Plan, Reasoning, Suggestion,
 * Task and Tool — were written, tested, exported and then imported by nothing
 * outside the dev gallery. That state is worse than absence: a component that
 * renders nowhere reads as "already migrated" in every audit while the
 * hand-rolled UI it was meant to replace stays in place, and its passing tests
 * give false confidence about code no user reaches. Each was checked against
 * this product's real transcript surfaces and deleted rather than force-fitted:
 *
 * - `Reasoning` / `ChainOfThought` — reasoning renders through assistant-ui's
 *   own static reasoning element instead
 *   (`components/assistant-ui/elements/reasoning-panel.tsx`, used via
 *   `ReasoningTrace`): a collapsible "Thought for Ns" panel of titled steps in
 *   the thread, and the same panel non-collapsible where the trail must stay
 *   visible (the process rail, the sub-agent drawer). A second, ai-elements
 *   port of the same idea would only diverge from it.
 * - `Plan` — `PlanReviewCard` is the real
 *   surfaces. The strip wants a plain `ui/Collapsible`, not `Task`'s
 *   search-icon trigger and bordered rail; the review card is a blocking
 *   decision surface that must not be collapsible at all.
 * - `Confirmation` — models the AI SDK's tool-part approval lifecycle.
 *   `ApprovalRequestCard` resolves approvals over an RPC with optimistic
 *   dispatch; the state machines do not correspond.
 * - `Artifact` — a side-panel document-viewer shell. `ArtifactCard` is a
 *   compact inline in_progress/ready/failed status row with a download action.
 * - `Suggestion` — there are no suggested-reply chips in this product.
 * - `Tool` — `ToolTimelineBlock` carries run-loop coalescing that upstream has
 *   no equivalent for and stays. Nothing else needs a tool-call renderer.
 *
 * `Conversation` and `Message` went the same way later: their only caller was
 * the legacy `ChatThreadView` transcript, which was replaced end to end by the
 * assistant-ui `Thread` (`components/assistant-ui/thread.tsx`), whose own
 * viewport and message primitives cover both.
 *
 * If one of these is wanted later, it is a `git log` away — but it should come
 * back with a caller in the same change.
