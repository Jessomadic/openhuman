/**
 * useUnroutedApprovals — the approvals no other surface will ever show.
 *
 * The approval gate parks a tool call and waits for a decision. Which surface
 * asks the user for that decision depends on where the call came from:
 *
 *   - a chat turn  -> `ApprovalRequestCard` in the transcript, routed by the
 *                     `approval_request` socket event's `thread_id`
 *   - a flow run   -> `FlowApprovalRequestCard`, routed by the park's
 *                     `source_context`
 *   - anything else-> nothing, until this hook
 *
 * That last case is not hypothetical. A background trigger run (a Composio
 * Gmail trigger reaching `triage.escalate`) has no chat thread and no flow
 * context, so the gate publishes `ApprovalRequested` with `thread_id: None`
 * and `client_id: None`, the web-channel subscriber drops it — its own log
 * line says "NOT surfacing" — and the park sits for its full 600 s TTL and is
 * denied as `[policy-denied]`. The user is never asked. Every escalated email
 * is silently dropped (openhuman#6406; the general form is openhuman#5746).
 *
 * ## Why poll the durable queue instead of listening for an event
 *
 * The defining property of this failure is that **nobody is looking**: the
 * trigger can fire with the app shut. A socket broadcast with no subscriber at
 * that instant is lost exactly as completely as the event the subscriber drops
 * today. `approval_list_pending` is session-agnostic and reads the persisted
 * `pending_approvals` rows, so a park raised while the app was closed is still
 * there when it opens. That is what openhuman#5746's first acceptance bullet
 * asks for in as many words: "an approvals inbox / queue ... rather than only
 * as an event on a bus nobody is listening to at that moment".
 *
 * It is also origin-agnostic. Anything the gate parks and no one claims shows
 * up here — `ExternalChannel` and `TrustedAutomation{Workflow}` parks
 * included, not just triage.
 *
 * ## The discriminator, and which way it fails
 *
 * A pending row carries no `thread_id`, so it cannot say on its own whether a
 * chat surface is already showing it. Two exclusions instead:
 *
 *   - a `source_context` means a flow surface owns it;
 *   - a `request_id` already in `pendingApprovalByThread` means the chat
 *     transcript is already showing its card.
 *
 * Everything else is unclaimed. If that is ever wrong the user sees one
 * approval in two places, which is the direction to be wrong in — the bug
 * being fixed is that they see it in none.
