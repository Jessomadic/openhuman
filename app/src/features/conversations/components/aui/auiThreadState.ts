/**
 * Optional-safe reads of the assistant-ui runtime for the CURRENT subtree.
 *
 * Two properties make these hooks usable from the transcript, and both are
 * load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **They read the runtime from React context**, never from
 *    `state.thread.selectedThreadId`. `AssistantUiRuntimeProvider` is
 *    thread-parameterized and the `Thread` is mounted by two hosts — the home
 *    chat (follows the selection) and `WorkflowCopilotPanel` (its own nested
 *    runtime on a dedicated builder thread). Reading the selection here would
 *    paint the home chat's state inside the copilot.
 *
 * 2. **They tolerate the runtime being absent.** Every selector goes through
 *    `s.optional.<scope>`, which resolves to `undefined` rather than throwing
 *    when no `AuiProvider` is above the component (assistant-ui's default
 *    client throws on a direct `s.thread` read), so a component using them
 *    stays mountable in a test or preview without a runtime.
 *
 * Selectors are module-level constants: `useAuiState` keys its internal
 * memoization on selector identity, so an inline arrow would re-subscribe the
 * underlying `useSyncExternalStore` on every render of the chat's hot path.

/**
 * Whether the mounted runtime's adapter can honour message editing and the
 * branch picker.
 *
 * `useOpenHumanExternalStore` supplies `onEdit` (via the `threads.edit_message`
 * RPC, core workstream C4) and `setMessages` (a no-op stub — the core has no
 * per-branch message model yet, so `onEdit`/`onReload` both truncate the
 * thread's single lineage rather than forking one). Supplying either key at
 * all is what turns assistant-ui's `capabilities.edit` /
 * `capabilities.switchToBranch` on, so this hook reports both true whenever a
 * runtime is mounted and false only when none is (a test/preview host with no
 * `AuiProvider` above it).
 *
 * Both affordances in `components/assistant-ui/thread.tsx` are gated on this
 * (#5897): `UserMessage` renders the vendored `EditMessage` element only when
 * `canEdit`, and `BranchPicker` returns `null` unless `canSwitchToBranch`. The
 * gate stays in place rather than being deleted now that both are wired: an
 * edit button that looks supported and silently does nothing is worse than no
 * button, and the day the adapter regresses (loses `onEdit`/`setMessages`)
 * this hook is what turns the affordance back off automatically.

 *
 * - the vendored `EditMessage` element, gated on
 *   `useAuiEditCapabilities().canEdit`, replacing `UserMessage`'s plain
 *   bubble with `ComposerPrimitive.Root` / `.Input` for that turn;
 * - `BranchPickerPrimitive.Root` / `.Previous` / `.Number` / `.Count` /
 *   `.Next`, gated on `canSwitchToBranch`, rendered alongside the turn's
 *   existing copy / react / share action row.
 *
 * Both were deliberately absent rather than rendered-and-inert before #5897:
 * an edit button that looks supported and silently does nothing is worse than
 * no button. The gate stays wired now that the affordances are live, so a
