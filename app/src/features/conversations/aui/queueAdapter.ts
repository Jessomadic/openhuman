/**
 * The external-store `queue` adapter over the core's run queue.
 *
 * assistant-ui's own `createMessageQueue` keeps the queue in the browser and
 * dispatches from it. OpenHuman's queue lives in the core (`RunQueue`), so this
 * adapter is hand-rolled over it instead:
 *
 * - `items` are the core's queue items (`queueSlice`, fed by the
 *   `queue_item_*` socket events), which `ComposerPrimitive.Queue` and
 *   `s.composer.queue` read.
 * - `enqueue` and `steer` both go to the host send path. Once a runtime has a
 *   queue, assistant-ui routes every composer send through it (`steer` while
 *   running, `enqueue` when idle), and the host decides the `queue_mode`
 *   (`Conversations.handleComposerSend`: follow-up while streaming, a normal
 *   send otherwise), exactly as it did for `onNew`.
 * - `remove` asks the core to drop the item and only then drops it locally; a
 *   failed removal leaves the item showing, because the core will still send it.
 * - `move` and `edit` are no-ops: the core queue cannot reorder or rewrite.
