/**
 * Browser coverage for the shipped chat composer's file picker and interaction
 * gate. Six active cases cover named chips, archive/audio/unknown/original-video
 * acceptance, removal, streaming lockout, recovery after Stop, and attachment-only
 * Send. File acceptance does not depend on the selected model's vision support;
 * the core chooses native input or fallback processing after saving the original.
 *
 * The two synthetic clipboard cases remain explicitly skipped because this
 * harness cannot expose their image DataTransfer to Lexical reliably. They do
 * not prove clipboard behavior, and this file does not cover real drag-and-drop.
 * The product paste path accepts file items of any type through the same host
 * validator as the picker; ordinary text paste remains with the editor.
