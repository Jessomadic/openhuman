#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Browser-hosted variant of `pnpm dev:app`.
#
# `dev:app` renders the UI in the Tauri shell, which since the CEF -> Wry
# migration (#5456) is WKWebView on macOS / WebView2 on Windows / WebKitGTK on
# Linux. None of those speak the Chrome DevTools Protocol, so no CDP client --
# including the chrome-devtools MCP an agent drives -- can attach to the
# desktop window. This script runs the same SPA in a real browser instead:
#
#   openhuman-core (JSON-RPC :7788) <- fetch -- Vite dev server (:1420) in Chrome
#
# The renderer takes the browser path in `coreRpcClient` (`isTauri()` is false),
# reading the endpoint and bearer from `localStorage`. Those are seeded by the
# dev-server-only `/__dev-connect` page (see `devConnectPlugin` in
# `app/vite.config.ts`), which is where the browser is pointed first.
#
# Two modes:
#
# - Standalone (default): build and start a fresh `openhuman-core serve` with a
#   generated bearer. Sign-in is one click: the OAuth buttons pass
#   `<vite origin>/__dev-auth` as the backend redirectUri, and the session is
#   stored in that core's workspace.
#
# - Attach (`--attach`): reuse the core of the desktop app that is already
#   running -- and so its signed-in session. Its bearer is minted per launch and
#   held only in memory, so the browser is sent through the core's own dev-only
#   `GET /dev/connect?app=<vite origin>` (crates/openhuman-core/src/core/
#   dev_connect.rs), which redirects to `/__dev-connect` with the RPC URL and
#   bearer in the URL fragment. No token is read, printed, or pasted.
#
# Busy ports are not fatal: Vite and the standalone core each move to the next
# free port, and the URL that is printed/opened always reflects the real one.
#
# Usage:
#   pnpm dev:app:web                   # fresh core + vite, open the browser
#   pnpm dev:app:web --no-browser      # same, just print the URL (for agents)
#   pnpm dev:app:web:attach            # vite on the running desktop core
#   pnpm dev:app:web --attach --no-browser
#   pnpm dev:app:web --onboarding      # keep onboarding + tour (skipped by default)
#
# Env:
#   OPENHUMAN_DEV_PORT    preferred Vite port (default 1420)
#   OPENHUMAN_CORE_PORT   standalone: preferred core port (default 7788)
#                         attach: the desktop core's port (default: scan 7788-7808)
#   OPENHUMAN_CORE_TOKEN  standalone: bearer to use (default: generated per run)
#   OPENHUMAN_WORKSPACE   standalone: core workspace (default: ~/.openhuman)
