// Per-crate `#[ignore]` ratchet. The count may only go down.
//
// What this counts is `#[ignore]` ATTRIBUTES PRESENT IN THE SOURCE TREE — not
// tests libtest skips at runtime. The two numbers differ and the difference is
// not fully explained: `openhuman-core` has 96 attributes in source while a
// scoped `--lib` run reported 83 ignored. Feature gating accounts for exactly
// one of those (the listener-shutdown test, since moved to `openhuman-rpc`), so the rest is open. The static count
// is the right thing to ratchet anyway: it is what a reviewer actually adds in
// a diff, and it is deterministic without a build or a feature-set choice —
// which is why this gate can run in `rust-quality` before clippy instead of
// waiting on the full-suite lane (#5021).
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/ci/check-ignored-tests.mjs
//   node scripts/ci/check-ignored-tests.mjs --write-baseline
