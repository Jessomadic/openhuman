//! What the agent is allowed to do.
//!
//! # The trap this type exists to close
//!
//! Access is governed by **two independent mechanisms**, and setting only the
//! obvious one produces an agent that looks configured and silently refuses to
//! act:
//!
//! 1. **The autonomy tier** (`config.autonomy.level`) drives `SecurityPolicy` —
//!    which command classes are allowed, prompted, or blocked.
//! 2. **The turn origin** (a task-local, [`AgentTurnOrigin`]) is the caller's
//!    statement of authority, and the approval gate is *fail-closed* on it. An
//!    unlabelled call site is hard-denied for external-effect tools regardless
//!    of tier.
//!
//! An embedder that sets `level = "full"` and nothing else gets a turn whose
//! `shell`, `edit`, `apply_patch` and `*_exec` calls all refuse — with a
//! plausible-looking transcript, because the model narrates around the refusals.
//! It reads as a weak model rather than a missing scope, which is what makes it
//! expensive to diagnose. [`Access`] therefore always yields **both** halves
//! together, and they cannot be set independently.
