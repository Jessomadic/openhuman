//! OpenHuman on the hosted TinyHumans backend.
//!
//! Layering, bottom up:
//!
//! - `openhuman-core` runs agents, memory, tools and RPC and knows the backend
//!   only through a port, [`BackendTransport`]. It has no SDK dependency and
//!   runs without any TinyHumans connection.
//! - `openhuman-embed` is the library facade over the core.
//! - **this crate** implements the port with the vendored `tinyhumans-sdk`
//!   ([`SdkBackendTransport`]), installs it into a process ([`install`]),
//!   offers a [`RuntimeBuilder`] that boots an embed runtime already
//!   connected, registers the hosted-backend RPC proxies ([`hosted`]:
//!   billing, team, referral, announcements) with the core's controller
//!   registry, and owns the host-side **login and backend session**
//!   ([`session`]: [`SessionManager`], [`SessionClient`], [`CoreLink`]) — the
//!   core only ever *takes* a credential.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn demo() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! use openhuman_tinyhumans::{embed::Workspace, RuntimeBuilder};
//!
//! let runtime = RuntimeBuilder::new()
//!     .workspace(Workspace::Ephemeral)
//!     .api_key("th_...")
//!     .build()
//!     .await?;
//! # let _ = runtime;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! [`RuntimeBuilder`] is the configuration path: it hands the embed builder
//! the SDK transport, the hosted controllers and the Jev ranker through
//! embed's seam options, and forwards the embed presets and knobs. Hosts that
//! still boot the core themselves (a bare `run_core_from_args`, a
//! `CoreBuilder`, a test fixture) call [`install`] once before the first backend-touching
//! dispatch instead; it resolves the same wiring and applies it to the
//! process globals.
//!
//! This crate depends on `openhuman-embed` alone. Core internals it needs
//! come through embed's `#[doc(hidden)] __host` list; it re-exports only its
//! own curated surface, never the core.
