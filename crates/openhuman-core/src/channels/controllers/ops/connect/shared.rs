/// Only listener-backed modes (those that materialise a TOML config block —
/// `has_config`) have a `channel:<id>` health component, kept current by the
/// supervisor's `ChannelConnected`/`ChannelDisconnected` events. For those, a
/// live `error` overrides the optimistic presence-based `connected` and carries
/// the failure reason to the UI; an `ok` confirms it. While the listener is
/// still `starting` (or has no component yet) we keep the presence-based value
/// so a freshly-configured channel isn't reported as broken before its first
/// connect attempt. Modes without a runtime listener (e.g. managed-DM) are left
/// untouched. Returns `(connected, error)`.
