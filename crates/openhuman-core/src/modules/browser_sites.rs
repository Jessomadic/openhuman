//! What browser tasks learn about a site, kept for its next task.
//!
//! TinyComputer returns, with every finished task, the plan it ran
//! (`TaskReport.flow`) and the elements its steps found
//! (`TaskReport.learned`), and takes both back on `StartTask`: a ready `flow`
//! skips planning, and `memory` lets a step confirm a remembered element with
//! one yes/no question instead of searching the page for it. The module keeps
//! nothing between tasks; the host keeps it here, per site, in
//! `<workspace>/state/computer/sites/<site>.json`, readable by its owner
//! alone.
//!
//! - Only a task that finished (`done`, or stopped at its payment checkpoint)
//!   teaches anything.
//! - A plan is reused only for the same goal, with the same facts, on the
//!   same site. It is kept only when its run needed no rescue and its steps
//!   hold no fact value the goal does not. A task that fails, or needs a
//!   rescue, on a reused plan forgets it, and so does a module that refuses
//!   it, the task then being planned afresh.
//! - An element whose name, key or place holds a fact value, however the
//!   module spells it, or whose name reads like page text rather than a
//!   control's label, is not kept.
//! - What no finished run has used for 30 days is dropped, and a site's file
//!   goes 30 days after it last changed.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches the agent's memory or its prompts: plans and elements
//! go to the module alone. `browser.learn_from_tasks` turns learning off, and
//! `modules.browser_forget_sites` forgets one site or every site, also for
//! tasks still running there.
