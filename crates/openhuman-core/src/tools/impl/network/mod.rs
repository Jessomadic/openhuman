//! Network tools: GitBooks docs lookup, Gmail unsubscribe, and (under the
//! `mcp` feature) the MCP client/setup tools, plus the host adapter for the
//! tools that live in `tinytools_std::network` (`http_request`, `web_fetch`,
//! `curl`, `pushover`). [`gate`] implements `NetGate` for `SecurityPolicy` and
//! [`host`] supplies the limits, HTML engine and x402 payment hook those tools
//! are handed. `url_guard` (in `tinytools_std`) is the shared SSRF/allowlist
//! validator. Registration gates are documented in `tools/impl/README.md`.
