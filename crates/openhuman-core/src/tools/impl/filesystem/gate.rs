/// Clone `security` and scope it to `root`, a run's workspace descriptor root.
///
/// The root becomes both the relative-path resolution root (`action_dir`)
/// **and** a `ReadWrite` trusted root. The grant is the load-bearing half:
/// `action_dir` only decides where a relative path lands, while the allow/deny
/// decision reads `workspace_dir` + `trusted_roots`
/// (`SecurityPolicy::is_resolved_path_allowed_for`). Without the grant a
/// descriptor rooted outside `workspace_dir` moved the cwd but refused every
/// read and write in it.
///
/// The grant is *additive and per-call*: it is pushed onto a clone, so nothing
/// process-global is mutated and concurrent turns cannot race each other. It
/// also cannot widen the hard invariants: `is_always_forbidden` (credential
/// stores, core OS dirs) and `is_workspace_internal_path` (core-managed state
/// under `workspace_dir`) are both evaluated *before* any trusted-root
/// shortcut, so a granted root can never expose them.
///
/// The root always originates from trusted in-process code (the session
/// builder, the sub-agent runner, or the `cwd` RPC parameter), never from
/// model-supplied text.
