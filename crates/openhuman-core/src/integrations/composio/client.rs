//! Host-side Composio route resolution and the direct-mode v3 reads.
//!
//! The Composio HTTP client itself lives in the `tinyconnectors` module and is
//! reached through [`super::module_client`]. What remains here is the part the
//! module does not decide for the host: which route the config selects
//! ([`resolve_composio_route`]) and the two direct-mode v3 reads
//! ([`direct_list_connections`], [`direct_list_tools`]), which run in the module
//! as stateless members under the host's key-health gate, proxy and TLS policy.
//!
//! Logging uses the `[composio]` grep-prefix so all sidecar output for
//! this domain can be filtered in one shot.
