//! Contract gate for late-bound Composio actions (#4853).
//!
//! Per-action Composio tools are built from the lightweight `list_tools`
//! response — a one-line description with a parameter schema that is often
//! thin or absent. The model therefore composes calls before the action's
//! FULL contract is in context and guesses argument formats — most visibly, it
//! sends Gmail `query` strings without the quoting Gmail search syntax requires,
//! so `GMAIL_FETCH_EMAILS` returns zero results.
//!
//! The gate makes the full contract enter context BEFORE execution: on the
//! first call to an action this turn, if a fuller live contract is available
//! (via the cached `fetch_live_toolkit_catalog`), it is returned as a
//! recoverable tool error instead of executing. The retry — now with the
//! schema/description in context — proceeds normally. This mirrors the
//! discover-then-call discipline the generic `composio_execute` dispatcher
//! already expects (`composio_list_tools` → `composio_execute`), but enforces
//! it on the per-action surface where the model never sees the full schema.
//!
//! Scope: this pass gates the per-action Composio surface
//! ([`super::action_tool::ComposioActionTool`]). Generalising the same gate to
//! the `composio_execute` dispatcher, the MCP bridges, and the Workflow
//! dispatchers — plus resetting the per-turn state on context compaction — is
//! tracked as follow-up (a shared `ToolMiddleware` at the turn-harness seam is
//! the natural home; see the PR description).
