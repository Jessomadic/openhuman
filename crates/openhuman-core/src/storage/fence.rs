//! Epoch fencing for writes to leased storage scopes.
//!
//! A lease ([`super::lease`]) says which node owns a key; it does not stop a
//! node that lost the key from writing. A paused or partitioned holder keeps
//! running its in-process work until its heartbeat notices the loss, and in
//! that window its writes would land on top of the new holder's.
//!
//! A [`LeaseFence`] closes most of that window for the storage ports. It is
//! one grant (key, node, epoch) plus the scopes that grant protects. While a
//! fence is registered in a [`FenceRegistry`], every write a
//! [`FencedBackend`](super::fenced_backend::FencedBackend) sends to one of
//! those scopes first calls [`LeaseFence::check`], which refuses the write
//! with a typed [`FenceError`] when:
//!
//! 1. the fence is latched ([`LeaseFence::fence`]: the heartbeat lost the
//!    lease, or an earlier check saw it superseded);
//! 2. the grant ran out by this node's clock, less a skew margin
//!    ([`LeaseFence::check_local`], no I/O); or
//! 3. the stored lease record no longer names this node at this epoch, or
//!    has expired, or cannot be read (fail closed).
//!
//! # What this does not guarantee
//!
//! The check and the write are two operations. A holder that passes the
//! check and is then paused for longer than the remaining grant can still
//! land one write after a takeover. The ports offer no way to make the
//! write conditional on a document in another scope: `atomic_batch` is
//! optional (`Capability::Transactions`, MongoDB replica sets only) and has
//! no read-only guard op, and streams and blobs take no precondition at
//! all. Closing the race needs a fencing primitive in tinystoragedrivers
//! (a write guarded by a fence document's epoch, enforced by the driver).
//! The skew margin makes the race need a pause longer than the margin
//! *after* a successful check, rather than any pause at all.
//!
//! Scopes nobody registered pass through untouched, so a backend with an
//! empty registry (every single-user host) behaves exactly as before.
