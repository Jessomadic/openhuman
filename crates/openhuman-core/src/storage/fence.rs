//! Epoch fencing for writes to leased storage scopes.
//!
//! A lease ([`super::lease`]) says which node owns a key; it does not stop a
//! node that lost the key from writing. A paused or partitioned holder keeps
//! running its in-process work until its heartbeat notices the loss, and in
//! that window its writes would land on top of the new holder's.
//!
//! A [`LeaseFence`] closes that window for the storage ports. It is one
//! grant (key, node, epoch) plus the scopes that grant protects. While a
//! fence is registered in a [`FenceRegistry`], every write a
//! [`FencedBackend`](super::fenced_backend::FencedBackend) sends to one of
//! those scopes is checked twice.
//!
//! First, on this node, [`LeaseFence::check`] refuses the write with a typed
//! [`FenceError`] when:
//!
//! 1. the fence is latched ([`LeaseFence::fence`]: the heartbeat lost the
//!    lease, or an earlier check saw it superseded);
//! 2. the grant ran out by this node's clock, less a skew margin
//!    ([`LeaseFence::check_local`], no I/O); or
//! 3. the stored lease record no longer names this node at this epoch, or
//!    has expired, or cannot be read (fail closed).
//!
//! Then the storage driver enforces it. The write goes through
//! [`StorageBackend::for_scope_fenced`](tinystoragedrivers::StorageBackend::for_scope_fenced)
//! with [`LeaseFence::driver_fence`], so the driver re-reads the lease record
//! in the same atomic step as the write and refuses it
//! ([`ErrorKind::Fenced`](tinystoragedrivers::ErrorKind::Fenced)) unless the
//! record still names this node at this epoch, unreleased. A holder that
//! passes the first check and is then paused past a takeover cannot land
//! the write: the driver refusal latches the fence and surfaces as
//! [`FenceError::Superseded`].
//!
//! # Where the race is still open
//!
//! The driver step needs [`Capability::Fencing`](tinystoragedrivers::Capability::Fencing)
//! and a lease record in the storage ports. Without either, the write runs
//! after the first check alone, and a holder paused for longer than its
//! remaining grant *after* a successful check can still land one write after
//! a takeover:
//!
//! - MongoDB without transactions (a standalone server) has no fencing, and
//!   MongoDB blob writes cannot be fenced (GridFS cannot join a
//!   transaction);
//! - writes to a named database ([`StorageBackend::database`](tinystoragedrivers::StorageBackend::database))
//!   cannot see the lease record, which lives in the default database;
//! - file leases (hosts without a backend) keep no record in the ports, but
//!   they cannot be lost while the process lives either.
//!
//! The skew margin makes that race need a pause longer than the margin
//! after a successful check, rather than any pause at all.
//!
//! Scopes nobody registered pass through untouched, so a backend with an
//! empty registry (every single-user host) behaves exactly as before.
