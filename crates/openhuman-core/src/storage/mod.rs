//! The process's storage backend on the `tinystoragedrivers` ports.
//!
//! One URL picks where durable state that has moved onto the storage ports
//! lives: `OPENHUMAN_STORAGE_URL`, else `[storage] url` in `config.toml`
//! ([`crate::config::StorageConfig`]), else the default
//! ([`config::StorageMode`]). The default installs no backend: the large
//! stores keep their SQLite files, and the small ones (approvals, devices,
//! notifications, task sources) keep document tables inside their own `.db`
//! files, importing their old tables on first open ([`local`]). The value
//! `classic` opts out to the pure legacy layout.
//!
//! When a URL is set, the host opens it once at startup ([`open`]) and
//! installs it ([`install`]); domains reach it through [`installed`] and bind
//! their records to an agent with [`scope_for_agent`]. The first consumer is
//! the session store: the host installs TinyAgents' `DriverSessionStores`
//! over this backend, so transcripts, turn states, records and journals live
//! in it, one scope per agent.
//!
//! Drivers are Cargo features of this crate: `storage-sqlite`,
//! `storage-mongodb`, `storage-file` (memory is always available). A URL for a
//! driver the build does not carry fails at [`open`] naming the feature, so a
//! misconfigured deployment stops at boot instead of at its first write.
