/// the git ledger, not the memory domain. Splitting that into a separate test

/// The six read-only `session_db` controllers were removed in #6082: they
/// queried a session index that nothing in `src/` ever writes (permanently
/// empty in production, no frontend consumer). The three `run_ledger`
/// controllers live in the same module and read a table that *is* written
/// (from `web_chat::progress_bridge` and `agent::progress_tracing`), so they
/// must stay fully registered.
///
/// `run_ledger` is asserted present in the same test on purpose: the removal
/// took the dead read surface, not the run-ledger domain. Splitting that into a
/// separate test would let one pass while the other silently regressed.
