//! The ledger record a payment starts with, for callers outside the
//! `x402_request` tool (the `http_request` 402 fallback).
//!
//! The tool builds its own records inside the crate; this is the same rule for
//! the host's other writer, so both attribute a payment identically:
//! `session_id` is always the ledger's own session (so the session total counts
//! the payment) and `thread_id` is the chat thread from `APPROVAL_CHAT_CONTEXT`.
