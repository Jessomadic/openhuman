//! Whether memory work is free for the user right now.
//!
//! Background memory jobs that write a user's whole memory again (moving it
//! into a new layout, importing a local store) start on their own only when
//! that costs the user nothing; otherwise they wait for the user to start them.
//! [`free_period_active`] is the one check every such job asks:
//!
//! - **Not the hosted engine** (self-hosted CortexDB, or a host's own engine):
//!   always free here, because no TinyHumans credit is spent.
//! - **The hosted `tinyhumans` engine**: free only while the backend's memory
//!   free period is on (`GET /memory/free-period`, through the backend
//!   transport). The answer is cached for [`CACHE_TTL`] per backend.
//! - **Anything unknown** (memory off, signed out, no transport, an error, a
//!   backend without the route): not free, so nothing starts on its own.
