//! A migration end to end: detect, copy, switch, catch up, clean up.
//!
//! - **Detect.** No legacy memory: switch at once, and that is all; there is
//!   no job, no banner and no prompt.
//! - **Gates.** A legacy tree other accounts may share (a self-hosted key)
//!   moves only with the user's consent ([`Trigger::Manual`] with
//!   `takeover`). An automatic run starts, and goes on page by page, only
//!   while moving costs the user nothing; when that ends mid-run it pauses
//!   where it is, and resumes in a later free window or when the user starts
//!   it.
//! - **Copy, then switch.** Reads and writes move to the per-user tree only
//!   after every item that could be copied is verified there, so no turn
//!   ever reads an empty memory.
//! - **Catch up.** Writes to the legacy tree between the copy and the switch
//!   are picked up by copying once more; everything copied before replays.
//! - **Clean up.** Last, because it drops held recall packs.
//!
//! Every step saves its progress, so [`run`] called again (after a pause, a
//! crash or a restart) continues where the last one stopped.
