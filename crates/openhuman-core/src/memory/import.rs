//! Importing a v1 memory store into the selected engine.
//!
//! [`scan`] opens `<workspace>/memory/memory.db` read-only through
//! `tinymemory-import` and counts what it would import. [`start`] refuses to
//! run without explicit consent (importing uploads local data to the engine),
//! then runs in the background: a blocking reader walks the legacy store and
//! hands each item to the async side, which scrubs and stores it and advances
//! the resumable [`Checkpoint`]. Progress and the checkpoint persist in
//! `<workspace>/memory/import_state.json`, so a restarted import resumes where
//! the last one stopped (an item stored but not yet checkpointed is re-sent,
//! and the engine treats it as a replay). A batch the engine cannot take for
//! a transient reason (unreachable, overloaded, its indexer behind) is retried
//! with backoff; if the engine stays unavailable the run stops and, like an
//! import the app quit in the middle of, resumes on its own
//! ([`resume_interrupted`]). One stopped by a failure that is not about a
//! single item and will not pass by itself (credits exhausted, signed out)
//! waits for the user to start it again.
