//! Live execution runtime for agent-team members (#3374 PR4).
//!
//! PR1–PR3 shipped the durable team model, race-safe claiming, quality-gated
//! completion, and the read-only board. They were entirely *store-only*: a
//! claim flipped a row, nothing ran. This module makes a teammate actually
//! **execute** — [`start_member_run`] atomically claims a task for a member,
//! marks the member `active`, and spawns a background worker that drives a real
//! sub-agent to completion, captures its output as the task's completion
//! evidence, runs it through the existing quality gate, and returns the member
//! to `idle`.
//!
//! ## Root parent context
//!
//! Like the workflow engine (#3375), the worker is spawned from a controller
//! background task with no enclosing agent turn, so it builds a root
//! [`ParentExecutionContext`] (shared [`build_root_parent`]) and runs inside
//! [`with_parent_context`] — every nested `spawn_agent` then resolves a real
//! provider / tools / memory.
//!
//! ## Message delivery boundary
//!
//! Pending lead/teammate messages addressed to the member are injected into the
//! worker's prompt **at spawn** (a well-defined boundary), and are always
//! visible in the team timeline. Mid-turn injection into an already-running
//! harness loop is intentionally **not** supported — the orchestration layer has
//! no live inbox. Boundary delivery satisfies the issue's "see the message in the team
//! timeline or worker thread" criterion via both paths; a live inbox would be a
//! separate orchestration-layer change.
