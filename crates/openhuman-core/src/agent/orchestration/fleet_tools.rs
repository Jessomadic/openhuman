//! Which fleet-control tools a parent agent can actually call.
//!
//! The `[async_subagent_ref]` envelope and the ambient `[active_subagents]`
//! roster used to hard-code a full fleet vocabulary — `wait_subagent`,
//! `steer_subagent`, `wait_loop`, `close_subagent` — while the orchestrator's
//! definition deliberately dropped most of it (#5701: a sub-agent result is
//! delivered back automatically on a later turn, so nothing needs to block).
//! The model was told to call tools it did not have, spent an iteration
//! reasoning about the mismatch, and improvised (`shell echo "waiting for
//! subagent"`). Every delegation paid a full extra model call for nothing.
//!
//! This module reads the parent's definition once per render and answers
//! "does this parent see tool X?", so both texts only ever name tools that
//! are in the caller's belt.
