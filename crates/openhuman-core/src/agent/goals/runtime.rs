//! OpenHuman runtime adapters for tinyagents thread-goal accounting and the
//! host-specific mid-turn budget stop hook.
//!
//! These are the pieces that make a stored goal actually steer the agent
//! (Codex parity):
//!
//! - [`account_turn_against_goal`] folds a completed turn's token + time usage
//!   into the active goal, flipping it to `budget_limited` when the cap is
//!   crossed.
//! - [`GoalBudgetStopHook`] votes to stop an in-flight turn as soon as an
//!   *active* goal's running usage would exceed its budget. #4469 item 1: the
//!   stop is a graceful *pause*, not an instantaneous abort — the vote fires in
//!   the stop-hook middleware's `after_model`, and the harness drains the pause
//!   at the **top of the next iteration**, so the tool round for the model call
//!   that tripped the budget still runs and the turn's wrap-up summary may spend
//!   one more model call before the partial transcript is returned. It bounds
//!   an autonomous run to a small, deterministic overshoot past the ceiling
//!   rather than a hard cut at the exact accounting point.
