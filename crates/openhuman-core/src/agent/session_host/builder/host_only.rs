//! Host-only sessions: the host's belt is the whole belt.
//!
//! [`HostTurnTools`](super::HostTurnTools) adds a host's tools *beside* the
//! config-derived registry; a withheld config tool stays registered. That is
//! the right default for an embedder extending an agent, and the wrong one for
//! a host that hands an agent read-only tools over untrusted input (a PR-review
//! bot reading a diff) and must be certain the model can never act.
//!
//! [`OpenHumanSessionHost::from_config_host_only`] builds that session. Three
//! independent layers, so no single mistake re-opens the surface:
//!
//! 1. **Registry.** No config-derived tool is constructed and no delegation
//!    tool is synthesised; the belt is the host's tools and nothing else.
//! 2. **Policy.** [`HostOnlyToolPolicy`] denies every call whose name is not
//!    one of the host's, before the host's own gate is consulted, so even a
//!    model that names a built-in tool is refused.
//! 3. **Definition.** The session runs a narrowed copy of the definition
//!    ([`host_only_definition`]): no sub-agents (so the per-turn delegation
//!    refresh has nothing to add), no deferred tools, read-only sandbox, and
//!    no memory context.
