    ///      from the previous synthesis. Direct tools (`query_memory`,
    ///      `cron_add`, …) are untouched because their names are not in
    ///      that set.
    ///   2. Append the fresh specs, and replace [`Self::synthesized_tools`]
    ///      with the fresh instances — minus any name a durable tool owns,
    ///      which the durable tool keeps (the same rule the builder applies).
    ///   3. Replace `synthesized_tool_names` with the new set so the
    ///      next refresh has a clean mask to undo.
    ///
    /// This is safer than appending-only or strict-diff reconcile:
    ///
    ///   * Stale tools after a revoke can never leak — anything from the
    ///     previous synthesis is unconditionally dropped, the new set is
    ///     authoritative.
    ///   * Direct tools can never be accidentally removed — only names
    ///     in `synthesized_tool_names` are touched, and a durable name is
    ///     never added to that mask.
    ///   * Duplicate registration is impossible — the fresh set replaces the
    ///     previous one wholesale and is disjoint from `self.tools`, so a
    ///     name is registered at most once across both sets.
    ///
    /// **When to call**: on turn 1 only when the session was built
    /// without a prewarmed Composio cache snapshot, and on any
    /// subsequent turn where the connection set has changed since the
    /// last reconcile (detected via
    /// [`Self::last_seen_integrations_hash`] vs.
    /// [`crate::integrations::composio::cached_active_integrations`]).
    ///
    /// **Concurrency**: this cannot fail on a shared session. The synthesised
    /// instances live in their own [`OpenHumanSessionHost::synthesized_tools`] `Arc`, which is
    /// *replaced* rather than mutated in place — so an in-flight turn or a
    /// spawned sub-agent holding a clone never blocks reconciliation. Those
    /// readers keep the previous, self-consistent set for the rest of their
    /// turn; the superseded instances are freed when the last of them drops.
    ///
    /// This is what makes the schema and the executable surface inseparable.
    /// Reconciling into `self.tools` instead required `Arc::get_mut`, which
    /// fails under exactly that sharing — and the old code proceeded to
    /// reconcile `tool_specs` anyway, so the two halves drifted: a newly
    /// connected toolkit's delegate had a spec with no instance (and no policy
    /// decision, so the fail-closed visibility filter hid it — silently missing
    /// until a unique-owner refresh) while a revoked toolkit's delegate kept its
    /// instance with no spec — still registered and callable (#6145).

    /// no longer a way for this to half-apply, so the `bool` it used to hand
