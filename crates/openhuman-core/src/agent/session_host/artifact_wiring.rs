/// **A conservative default chosen for safety, not a retention policy.** The
/// artifact store had no bound at all — nothing anywhere deletes these files —
/// and shipping unbounded growth to fix a token-burn bug would trade one
/// problem for another. This is the smallest thing that cannot grow without
/// limit; the feature's owner should confirm or replace it.
///
/// Alternatives considered: a count cap (needs a policy for which artifacts are
/// worth keeping, which this code has no basis to decide), and a sweep at
/// session end (there is no single point where a session host ends, and a crash
/// would skip it entirely). Age is the only one of the three that is correct
/// without knowing the workload.
///
/// 24 hours because an artifact is only useful while the run that produced it
/// can still read it back, which is bounded by a turn — a day is already far
/// more generous than that window, and leaves a working day of artifacts
/// available for debugging a session after the fact.

/// The store used to be rooted at `action_dir` (or the per-turn workspace
/// descriptor's root) and hand the model a path relative to it. That kept the
/// pointer readable, but the action directory is very often a project the
/// agent is editing: every oversized tool output became a stray
/// `artifacts/tool-results/…` file in it, swept into `git add -A` and shipped
/// in the diff. In a coding benchmark one task's whole patch was twelve of
/// these files and a scratch test.
///
/// The store is now detached. It writes under the workspace and hands out the
/// **absolute** path, which resolves the same way whatever the turn's action
/// directory or workspace descriptor is, so the read path no longer has to be
/// matched against the write path (the #6483 trap: `FsGate::scoped_to_workspace`
/// moving relative resolution to the descriptor root). Reading it back is
/// policy: `SecurityPolicy::from_config` grants this directory as a read-only
/// trusted root, and `is_workspace_internal_path` already exempts it from the
/// internal-state boundary.
