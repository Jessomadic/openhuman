//! Mid-conversation availability notes, prepended to the user's next message
//! when an integration, MCP server or skill was connected or installed after

// Availability notes prepended to the next user message when something was
// connected or installed mid-conversation. They are *status*, not a task:
// the earlier "act on them immediately" phrasing read as an instruction and
// sent the orchestrator off to the integrations agent in the middle of an
// unrelated exchange ("so lets do 20-30 days then?" → "What are we doing with
// the inbox?"). The user's message that follows is the only thing to act on.
