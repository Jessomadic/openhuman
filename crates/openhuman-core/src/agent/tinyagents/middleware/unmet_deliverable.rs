//! A named output file that was never written, caught before the turn ends.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The turn already carries four rungs that *tell* the model to produce its
//! deliverable: the budget notice part-way through, the penultimate call's
//! narrowed writer belt, the concluding call's instruction, and the
//! requirements check. Every one of them is advice, and the orchestrator
//! prompt's rule ("when the request names an output file, that file is the
//! deliverable") is advice too. None of them observes whether anything was
//! written, so a turn that ignores all five ends with a careful account of
//! work nobody can use.
//!
//! That is not hypothetical. One run reconstructed a transcript, catalogued
//! eleven variants and resolved the domain it was asked for, listed the output
//! file in its own answer as "still outstanding", and ended the turn. Every
//! check that read the file failed on the file's absence rather than on
//! anything it contained; an earlier run of the same request, which wrote a
//! partly-filled file, was scored on its contents.
//!
//! # How a path is identified without parsing the request
//!
//! The obvious objection to reading paths out of a request is telling an
//! output from an input: a request routinely names both. Grammar ("write to"
//! versus "read from") would be the fragile way to decide.
//!
//! The existence check decides it instead, for free. A path the request names
//! as an input is already on disk, so it is never reported. A path that the
//! request names and that nothing has created is, by construction, either a
//! deliverable that was skipped or a path the request mentioned in passing —
//! and the cost of the second case is one advisory sentence.
