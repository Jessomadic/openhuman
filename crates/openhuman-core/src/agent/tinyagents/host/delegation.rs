//! Multi-stage sub-agent delegation — the OpenHuman-facing seam onto
//! [`tinyagents_graph::delegation`] (issue #4249, #27/#28).
//!
//! The graph itself — the plan→execute⇄review→finalize state machine, its
//! revision budget, checkpoint/resume classification, durable human-approval
//! interrupt and cancellation handling — now lives upstream in the crate, where
//! it is reusable by any host and where its on-disk state shape is pinned by
//! tests. Nothing about it was OpenHuman-specific: the per-stage worker was
//! already injected, so the module named no host config, RPC, event bus or
//! security policy.
//!
//! ```text
//!   plan ─▶ execute ─▶ review ──approved/maxed──▶ finalize ─▶ END
//!             ▲                   │
//!             └─────revise────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! What stays here is this file: the historical spellings the rest of the core
//! imports, plus the one thing that genuinely is ours — the observability sink.
//!
//! # The sink is the reason these are wrappers, not plain re-exports
//!
//! Every delegation run is journalled onto OpenHuman's `tracing` diagnostics
//! through [`GraphTracingSink`](super::observability::GraphTracingSink), which
//! lives in [`super::observability`] alongside the cost catalog, the tool-status
//! classifier and the provider usage tables — host surface that must not follow
//! the graph upstream. The crate instead takes an optional
//! [`DelegationConfig::event_sink`], and the wrappers below attach ours when a
//! caller has not supplied one. Behaviour is unchanged from when the sink was
//! hard-wired into the graph builder: every run through this module is still
//! journalled under the `delegation:graph` label.
//!
//! A caller that sets `event_sink` explicitly keeps its own sink — the wrappers
//! fill a gap, they never override.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! Production wiring of the injected stage worker (dispatching each stage
//! through `run_subagent`, and the `SqliteCheckpointer` under the workspace) is
//! a separate concern and lives in
//! [`agent_orchestration::delegation`](crate::agent::orchestration::delegation),
//! which depends on both this seam and `subagent_host` — so this seam stays
//! free of orchestration dependencies.
