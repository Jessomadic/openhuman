//! Host [`BudgetGate`] backed by OpenHuman's scheduler gate, cost tracker, and
//! TokenJuice profile.
//!
//! This is `docs/specs/plan-agents.md` Phase 4. The agent runtime is being made
//! generic over its host, so it can no longer reach into
//! [`crate::cron::scheduler_gate`] or [`crate::cost`] directly.
//! It declares [`BudgetGate`] instead, and this module is the single place
//! OpenHuman's three metering concerns meet it:
//!
//! * **admission / back-pressure** — [`scheduler_gate::wait_for_capacity`],
//!   which owns the single-slot global LLM semaphore and the
//!   AC-power / CPU / signed-out policy backoff;
//! * **pricing hints and budgets** — [`cost::catalog::estimate_cost_usd`] on
//!   the way in, and the opt-in `[[cost.budgets]]` policies, which can refuse a
//!   call (`BUDGET_EXCEEDED`). The legacy `monthly_limit_usd` still refuses
//!   nothing. Nothing here writes the cost ledger: the event bridge records
//!   each model call under its real model, and a second write from this gate
//!   double-counted tokens and requests;
//! * **compression advice** — the agent's
//!   [`AgentTokenjuiceCompression`] profile, which decides how much lossy
//!   compaction that agent tolerates.
//!
//! # Contract mismatches, and how each is resolved
//!
//! **1. `Usage` carries no model and no cost.** The crate's
//! [`Usage`] is pure token counts, but
//! [`cost::record_provider_usage`] is keyed by model and priced from a
//! `charged_amount_usd`. Two consequences:
//!
//! * *Model attribution* — the gate remembers the model from the most recent
//!   [`BudgetGate::acquire`] and attributes [`BudgetGate::record`] to it,
//!   falling back to the session's configured model. A gate instance is
//!   per-session and the runtime calls `acquire` immediately before the call it
//!   then `record`s, so in practice the pairing holds; with two calls genuinely
//!   in flight on one gate the attribution can transpose. The alternative —
//!   dropping the record entirely — loses the spend, which is strictly worse
//!   for a budget guard.
//! * *Pricing* — with no provider-reported charge available, the pre-call
//!   estimate comes from the catalog and is only logged.
//!
//! **2. `compression_hint` must be cheap and synchronous**, but every budget
//! read in OpenHuman goes through a mutex and may touch the JSONL store. The
//! gate therefore caches a three-state budget pressure in an atomic, refreshed
//! on the async [`acquire`](Self::acquire) / [`record`](Self::record) paths —
//! exactly the "anything that needs I/O belongs in `record`, whose result this
//! can then consult" shape the trait documents.
//!
//! **3. The hint is a union with `SummarizationPolicy`, never an override.**
//! Returning [`CompressionHint::None`] here means *OpenHuman is not asking for
//! compression for a budget reason*; it is not a veto, and the crate's own
//! window-pressure policy still runs. That is why an agent whose TokenJuice
//! profile is `Off` yields `None` rather than anything stronger — `Off` opts
//! that agent out of *TokenJuice*, not out of summarization.
//!
//! Nothing here bypasses an OpenHuman guard: the scheduler-gate permit is held
//! for exactly the lifetime of the crate permit.
