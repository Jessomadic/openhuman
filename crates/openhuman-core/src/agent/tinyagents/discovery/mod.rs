//! What ranks a `tool_search` in this process.
//!
//! The tinyagents harness owns tool discovery — the intrinsic `tool_search` /
//! bridge over every `ToolExposure::Deferred` registration (called by name once found), a BM25
//! catalogue, and a slot for a host ranker (`tool::discover`). This module is
//! the host's side of that slot: which [`ToolRanker`] the process installed
//! (a decision model such as Jev, installed by `openhuman-tinyhumans`; the
//! core itself installs none) and how `agent.tool_search` in the config says
//! to use it. [`discovery_policy`] turns the two into the
//! [`ToolDiscoveryPolicy`] every turn harness runs with.
//!
//! Process-wide, like the backend transport, because the credential a
//! decision-model ranker needs is a property of the process's signed-in
//! user, and the harness is assembled per turn without a config in hand.
