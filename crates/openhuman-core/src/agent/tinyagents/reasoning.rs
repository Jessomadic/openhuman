//! The user's reasoning ("thinking") choice for an agent turn, resolved into
//! the provider-neutral [`ReasoningConfig`] the harness attaches to every
//! model request (`RunPolicy::default_reasoning`).
//!
//! Precedence, highest first:
//!
//! 1. the thread's own choice, recorded by `channel_web_chat`'s
//!    `reasoning_effort` param ([`apply_requested_effort`]) — read at turn
//!    start, so changing it never evicts the thread's warm session;
//! 2. the turn model's own level, `runtime.reasoning_effort_by_model`;
//! 3. `runtime.reasoning_effort` in the session's effective config;
//! 4. `runtime.reasoning_enabled = false`, meaning "no reasoning".
//!
//! Nothing set means the provider keeps its own default.
