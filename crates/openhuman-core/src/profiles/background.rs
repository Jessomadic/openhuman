//! Background work for profiles.
//!
//! A single-user core drains its memory job queue from a cron system job,
//! gated by the process-wide scheduler gate. Neither fits SaaS: the cron
//! service is off, and the gate reflects the operator (who holds no
//! credential) rather than any user. Instead, one loop per process visits the
//! provisioned profiles:
//!
//! - it closes profiles that have sat idle past `idle_evict_secs`;
//! - for each profile whose workspace has queued memory jobs (deferred ingests,
//!   belief builds), it opens the profile and runs the due jobs **under that
//!   profile's context**, so the jobs read that user's config, credential and
//!   memory root and nobody else's.
//!
//! Before a profile's jobs start, its lease fence is checked against the
//! stored lease record, and the jobs are dropped mid-run if the profile is
//! fenced meanwhile ([`super::fence`]).
//!
//! Users run one after another, and the memory job queue serialises them
//! further; a single slow user delays the rest of a tick, never another
//! user's data.
