//! A profile's lease fence: which scopes its grant guards, and how the host
//! registers, renews and retires it.
//!
//! When [`ProfileHost::open`](super::ProfileHost::open) takes a profile's
//! lease it builds a [`LeaseFence`] for the grant and registers it with the
//! host's [`FenceRegistry`] (the process registry, which every backend from
//! `storage::open` consults). From then on each write through the storage
//! ports to one of the profile's scopes is checked against the grant:
//!
//! - the profile's own scope (`storage::scope_for_profile`), where its
//!   domain stores, secrets, cron and flows keep their records;
//! - every session scope of the profile (`<profile>~<agent>`,
//!   `core::runtime::session_key_prefix`), where the session store keeps
//!   transcripts and turn states.
//!
//! The heartbeat records each renewal on the fence and latches it when the
//! lease is lost; a write check that finds the record moved on latches it
//! too. A latched fence stays registered, refusing writes, for as long as
//! the fenced profile's context is alive (in-flight work holds it), and is
//! replaced when this node opens the profile again. A clean release (idle
//! eviction, `profiles.release`, shutdown) retires it.
//!
//! # File leases
//!
//! Without a storage backend the host uses `LocalLeases` (an `flock`). That
//! lease cannot be lost while the process lives: nobody else can take the
//! lock, and the OS drops it only when the holder dies. Nothing goes
//! through the storage ports either (no backend is installed), so the fence
//! is registered but never consulted by a write; `ensure_hosted` and the
//! background loop still read its latch. Two hosts on one root are kept
//! apart by the lock itself, and only on a filesystem where `flock` works
//! (not most network filesystems).
