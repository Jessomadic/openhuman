//! Post-turn follow-up-suggestion generation for the web chat surface.
//!
//! After a normal, single-user turn's `chat_done` has already gone out
//! (`web_chat::presentation::deliver_response`), this module spawns a
//! **cheap** local-model call — same shape as `threads/ops/title_generation.rs`'s
//! `summarization`-role title call — that turns the last user message plus
//! the assistant's answer into 2-3 short follow-up prompts, then emits a
//! `chat_suggestions` socket event carrying them.
//!
//! Design constraints (per the C5 workstream brief):
//! - **Never delays `chat_done`.** The caller spawns this on
//!   `CoreContext::propagate` *after* publishing the terminal event; a slow
//!   or failed suggestions call only means no `chat_suggestions` ever
//!   arrives, never a delayed reply.
//! - **Strict JSON, drop on failure.** The model is asked for a bare JSON
//!   array; anything that doesn't parse into that shape is dropped silently
//!   (`chat_suggestions` simply never fires for that turn) rather than
//!   surfaced as an error the user would have to make sense of.
//! - **Bounded.** A single [`SUGGESTIONS_TIMEOUT`] wraps the model call.
//! - **Disable-able.** Gated on `Config::web_chat.suggestions_enabled`
//!   (`config/schema/web_chat_config.rs`, default `true`).
//! - **Only for the surface it makes sense on.** The caller
//!   (`web_chat::presentation::deliver_response`'s `suggest_follow_ups`
//!   parameter) opts this in only for the main single-user chat turn
//!   (`web_chat::ops::start_chat`) — not for the parallel-fork path
//!   (`ops::parallel_turn`), the Flow Canvas copilot streaming path
//!   (`flows::ops::streaming`), or background/single-bubble delivery
//!   (`agent::orchestration::background_delivery`), none of which have a
//!   human waiting on suggestions for their next message.
