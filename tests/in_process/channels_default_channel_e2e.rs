//! Default messaging channel: `channels_set_default` / `channels_get_default`.
//!
//! # Why this target exists
//!
//! Both methods are in the domain-e2e gate's uncovered list
//! (`scripts/check-domain-e2e-coverage.mjs`), which counts only
//! `tests/**/*_e2e.rs` targets. Before this file the complete picture was:
//!
//! * `app/src/services/api/channelConnectionsApi.ts:255`, `:263` — **shipped
//!   frontend code** calls both.
//! * `app/src/services/api/channelConnectionsApi.test.ts:47-60` — a Vitest that
//!   asserts the client *emits the right method name* against a mocked
//!   transport. It never reaches the core, so it would keep passing if both
//!   controllers were deleted tomorrow.
//! * Four WDIO/Playwright specs call `channels_set_default` as **setup** and
//!   assert nothing about it.
//!
//! So the round trip had no coverage anywhere above a mocked transport.
//!
//! # What is actually worth asserting
//!
//! A bare set→get round trip is the weak half. `channels/proactive.rs:100-116`
//! documents the interesting invariant: `channels_set_default` mutates the live
//! proactive subscriber's `active_channel` handle **in place** via
//! `set_runtime_active_channel`, "so a default-channel switch from the UI takes
//! effect without a restart" (issue #3712, "switch default channel
//! Telegram<->Discord"), and `proactive.rs:226-240` reads that handle back on
//! every proactive delivery. The failure that bug describes is: config
//! persists, the live handle does not update, proactive messages keep going to
//! the old channel until the process restarts — and a test that only reads the
//! config back cannot see it.
//!
//! **That assertion IS made here** — see
//! `set_default_applies_to_the_live_proactive_handle`. An earlier revision of
//! this file omitted it, on the reasoning that `proactive.rs:135-138` says
//! `set_runtime_active_channel` is "a no-op when no subscriber has registered a
//! handle (e.g. unit tests)", so the assertion would pass vacuously. **That was
//! wrong**: `register_active_channel_handle` (`proactive.rs:129`) is `pub`, so
//! the test registers its own handle and no channel runtime is needed. The
//! non-vacuity control is asserting the handle reads `None` *before* the call —
//! without it, "still unset afterwards" would look like a pass.
//!
//! So this target asserts the persistence and live-apply halves over the wire.
//! The op-level round trip, canonicalisation and `"web"` fallback live in
//! `channels/controllers/ops_connect_status_tests.rs`, and the get/set wire
//! shapes in `domain_modules_e2e`.
//!
//! No network: `api_url` points at a closed port.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo test -p openhuman-cli --test in_process_all`
