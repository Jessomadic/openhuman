//! Shared driver matrix for the `storage_*_e2e` suites and
//! `cli_storage_url_e2e`.
//!
//! Every suite that exercises the core on a configured storage backend runs
//! the same body once per driver, each as its own test case named after the
//! driver (`memory::...`, `sqlite::...`, `file::...`, `mongodb::...`), so a
//! failure says which driver broke:
//!
//! - `memory`: always;
//! - `sqlite`: when the `storage-sqlite` feature is compiled in, on a temp
//!   directory (the desktop default, one `.db` file per database);
//! - `file`: when the `storage-file` feature is compiled in, on a temp
//!   directory;
//! - `mongodb`: when `storage-mongodb` is compiled in AND `TSD_MONGO_URL` is
//!   set (a replica set, as `tinystoragedrivers`' CI uses). Each case gets a
//!   database of its own (`oh_e2e_<uuid>`), so runs never see each other's
//!   records and scopes stay isolated. With `TSD_MONGO_URL` unset the case
//!   passes after printing that it was skipped.
//!
//! The backend slot is process-wide, so the cases of one binary run one at a
//! time (they share [`Case`]'s lock) and the slot is emptied when a case ends,
//! pass or fail.
//!
//! Include with `#[macro_use] mod storage_drivers;` and declare the body with
//! `driver_cases!(sync body)` (or `async body`), where `body` is
//! `fn(Case)` (or `async fn(Case)`); `driver_cases!(url body)` takes a
//! `fn(UrlCase)` for suites that spawn `openhuman-core` against the URL.
