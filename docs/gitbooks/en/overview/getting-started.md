# Getting started

This page takes you from install to your first request. OpenHuman is open source under the GNU GPL3 license, and the code is at [github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want a specific outcome, such as a private assistant, a local model, a broken install fixed, or a move to a new machine, the [Guides](../guides/README.md) have task-by-task walkthroughs.
{% endhint %}

## System requirements

OpenHuman runs on macOS, Windows and Linux desktops. 4 GB of RAM is recommended. Plan for 16 GB or more if you will ingest very large mailboxes or repos, or run a [local model](../features/model-routing/local-ai.md) on the same machine. For a local model you install the runtime (such as Ollama) and pull the models yourself.

The first time you launch the app, your OS asks for the permissions it needs: Accessibility on macOS, and Input Monitoring for the voice hotkey. You can review them any time under **Settings**.

## 1. Download and install

Download the desktop app from [tinyhumans.ai/openhuman](https://tinyhumans.ai/openhuman) or the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/releases/latest). You can also use the install scripts, which download the release and check its SHA-256 before installing:

```bash
# macOS and Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

A Homebrew cask also exists, but it can lag the latest release. Open the app once it is installed.

## 2. Sign in

The first screen is **Sign in! Let's Cook**. You can sign in with social login or other options. An **Advanced** panel lets you point the app at a custom core RPC URL if you run your own backend. Most people can ignore it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Signing in does not give OpenHuman ongoing access to anything. Each third-party integration needs its own OAuth approval in the steps below.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your workspace config and runtime state live on your machine. The default setup still uses OpenHuman-hosted services for sign-in, model routing, managed integration OAuth and tool calls, and web search. Use the custom setup paths to bring your own model, search or Composio credentials. Some hosted features and real-time integration triggers need the managed backend.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Connect something and set up memory

Onboarding asks how AI should run. You can use the managed TinyHumans route, or a custom setup where you bring your own model, search, embeddings and connector keys. Then it drops you into the app. Two things make your first request worth making:

- **An integration.** Open [Connections](../features/connections.md), then Apps, and connect one. Gmail is a common first choice. Each connection is a one-click OAuth approval that you can revoke.
- **A memory engine.** Open Connections, then Memory. When you are signed in, the hosted engine is already there. Otherwise point it at your own CortexDB. With neither, [memory](../features/memory.md) is off and the agent starts from zero every chat.

Add the integration as a memory source on the Brain tab to sync it on a schedule.

## 4. Run your first request

Once a memory source has synced, try prompts like these.

Briefings:

- "What do I need to know from the last 12 hours?"
- "What's waiting on me?"

Cross-source questions:

- "Summarize what I missed today."
- "What are the key decisions from this week?"
- "Extract action items from my recent conversations."
- "What did Sarah say about the project across email and chat?"

OpenHuman picks the right model for each task. See [Automatic model routing](../features/model-routing/README.md).

## 5. Keep going

Now that the agent has memory and a model, the rest of the product gives it more to work with:

- [Chat](../features/chat.md): what a turn can do, and the four ways it stops to ask you something.
- [Connections](../features/connections.md): everything the agent plugs into, on one page.
- [Memory](../features/memory.md): connect more sources and sync them on a schedule.
- [Workflows](../features/workflows.md): describe an automation and review the graph the agent proposes.
- [Native voice](../features/native-tools/voice.md): dictation, spoken replies, or a live voice agent.
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md): what is coming, and what was removed.
