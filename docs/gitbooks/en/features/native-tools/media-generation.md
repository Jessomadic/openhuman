# Image and video generation

OpenHuman can make media, not just read it. Ask for "an image of…", "edit this screenshot to…" or "animate this photo into a short clip", and a dedicated media sub-agent takes over. You need no plugin, no API key and no separate billing.

## What it can do

- **Image generation and editing.** Text-to-image and image editing through hosted GMI models (Seedream for generation, SeedEdit for edits).
- **Video generation.** Text-to-video, or animate a reference image into a clip (Seedance or Veo). Video is asynchronous. The agent starts the render and collects the clip when it is done.
- **Model discovery.** The agent can list the media models available now and pick the right one.

## How it works

The `media_generation` domain (`crates/openhuman-core/src/media/generation/`) gives the agent three tools: generate image, generate video and list models. They use the OpenHuman backend's media-generation provider. The backend owns the provider keys, billing and rate limiting, and your subscription covers it like any other model call.

The tools submit a job and then poll every 4 seconds, for up to 180 seconds for images and 420 seconds for video. You and the agent see live progress instead of a hung call. Finished files are downloaded into the `generated-media/` folder of your workspace and returned as local file paths, ready to attach, post or edit further.

## Privacy

Prompts and reference media go to the OpenHuman backend and on to the hosted media provider. The in-app capability catalog discloses this (`intelligence.image_generation` and `intelligence.video_generation`, both Beta).

[Privacy mode](../privacy-mode.md) local-only enforcement covers inference providers only. The media tools still call the backend, so avoid them if you need strict no-egress today.
