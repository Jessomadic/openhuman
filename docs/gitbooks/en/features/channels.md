# Messaging channels

A channel is a messaging app the agent uses to talk to you. You message the agent on a platform you already use, and it replies there. A channel is the opposite of an [integration](integrations/README.md). An integration is mostly something the agent reads from, such as your inbox, calendar or CRM. A channel is a two-way conversation.

Every channel follows the same small contract: one path to send messages and one to listen. That is why the same agent loop can serve Telegram, Discord, the built-in web chat and a dozen others without per-platform code.

## What a channel does

A channel handles two directions.

**Inbound.** When a message arrives, the channel turns it into a standard message (sender, reply target, content, optional thread id) and hands it to the dispatch loop. Dispatch starts or resumes an agent run, limits its tools, and the agent works on the request. Some platforms support `/models` and `/model` to switch the model for that sender's session. Telegram also supports remote-control commands.

**Outbound.** The agent's reply goes back through the same channel to your reply target, in a thread when the platform supports it. A channel can also send proactively, with no incoming message, when a [trigger](integrations/triggers.md) or a cron job fires. A channel receives proactive messages only if it has a default delivery target. Channels without one are skipped.

Where the platform allows it, channels can show a typing indicator, stream draft updates, post threaded replies and add emoji reactions. Each channel declares what it supports.

## Supported channels

OpenHuman has 15 channel providers. 14 are built into the shipped desktop app. WhatsApp Web sits behind the `whatsapp-web` build feature, which the shipped app does not enable, so you can't switch it on. The in-app Web chat is built in and is not a provider. A separate `cli` channel serves the `openhuman-core` terminal binary. Eight channels have a setup flow in the app: Telegram, Discord, Web, iMessage, Lark/Feishu, DingTalk, Email and 元宝 (Yuanbao). You turn on the rest by hand in `config.toml`.

Matrix is no longer supported. The config parser still accepts a `[channels.matrix]` section, but the provider was removed, so it is logged and skipped.

WhatsApp also has an experimental peer-to-peer variant behind the `whatsapp-web` feature. Channels that use a webhook receive messages by HTTP push, so they need an HTTPS endpoint that the provider can reach.

Telegram has the most features. It supports typing indicators and live draft updates, and it is the only channel with its own approval surface, so approval prompts can be answered inline. Discord adds native threaded replies, and Lark threads too. Web supports rich text and stays entirely local.

### Email

Email is a native, self-hosted connector with no third-party broker. Inbound mail arrives over IMAP IDLE push, so new mail reaches the agent in seconds. The connection refreshes about every 29 minutes, as the RFC requires. Replies go out over SMTP with full attachment support, from your own address on any provider you configure.

An `allowed_senders` list controls who can reach the agent by email. Set it to the addresses you trust. In `config.toml`, an empty list denies everyone. The Connections UI is different: a blank field becomes `["*"]`, which allows any sender. Don't leave it blank if strangers should not be able to prompt your agent.

## Credential modes

Channels sign in one of three ways.

- **Connect via OpenHuman (managed).** A one-click encrypted connection brokered by the OpenHuman backend. It covers Telegram (message the managed bot directly) and Discord (link your account or install through OAuth). No tokens are stored on your machine.
- **Your own credentials.** You supply a bot token, API key and secret, or app credentials. Telegram (BotFather token), Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Lark/Feishu, DingTalk, Yuanbao, Signal, Mattermost, QQ, Linq, IRC and Email all support this. You get the most control, and you own the platform account, rate limits and any webhook endpoint.
- **Local, no credentials.** Web chat and iMessage need no tokens. Web runs inside the desktop app. iMessage drives the local macOS Messages app through AppleScript, so grant Full Disk Access. Both keep messages on your machine.

Secrets for any mode go through OpenHuman's credential layer and are encrypted at rest (see [Privacy and security](privacy-and-security.md)). Channels managed in the UI never write secrets to `config.toml` in plaintext.

## Where to connect a channel

Set up channels under **Connections > Channels** in the left sidebar, not under Settings. Open that tab, pick a platform tile and follow its setup card:

- **Discord.** Choose Connect via OpenHuman (link your account or install the bot through OAuth), or paste your own bot token.
- **Telegram.** Message the managed OpenHuman bot to link, or paste a BotFather token.

Slack is connected as an app under **Connections > OAuth** so the agent can read and act in Slack. It is not set up as a talk-back channel in the Channels tab.

## Choosing the default channel

In **Connections > Channels** you can pick the active route, which is the channel used for proactive messages with no recipient, such as cron jobs and triggers. The default is the in-app Web chat. A new default takes effect immediately, with no restart, and the panel shows which channel is active. Replies to inbound messages always go back on the channel they came from, whatever the default is.
