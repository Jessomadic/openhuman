# Security

`crates/openhuman-core/src/security/` is the trust boundary for the autonomous core. Look here first when you ask "is this agent action allowed, and if so, how is it confined?"

It owns:

- The autonomy and risk policy that decides whether a tool call is allowed.
- The sandbox selection that confines calls when the host supports it.
- The append-only audit log of every agent action.
- The encrypted secret store.
- The pairing guard that gates public binding of the RPC server.
- The `redact()` helper every other domain uses to keep plaintext credentials out of logs.

It does not own the cross-domain `EncryptionEngine` (in `security/encryption/`) or per-channel credential storage (in `security/credentials/`).

## Sandboxing

This module carries no sandbox backends. Per-session sandbox selection lives in `crates/openhuman-core/src/sandbox/`. It delegates local OS confinement to `tinybox-jail` (vendored tinybox) and keeps its own `docker run` executor. Command classification scans shell strings with `tinybox_core::shell::scan`, and the classification rules stay in this module.

## Autonomy ladder

`AutonomyLevel` is a three-step ladder that sets how strictly the policy gates tool calls. It only takes effect while `[autonomy] enabled = true`.

- `ReadOnly` blocks every writing class outright. No approval can authorize one.
- `Supervised` is the default. It allows reads and parks everything else for an approval round trip.
- `Full` allows reads and writes. It still parks the network, install and destructive classes.

The wire spellings are lowercase (`readonly`, `supervised`, `full`). The user-facing table is in [Approval gate](../../features/approval-gate.md).

`CommandRiskLevel` and `ToolOperation` classify a tool call. `ActionTracker` keeps the per-session counts that the policy compares against its caps. The agent harness asks `SecurityPolicy` for a decision before every executable tool dispatch.

All of this applies only when the autonomy policy is on. `[autonomy] enabled = false` is the default, and `SecurityPolicy::from_config` carries that flag through every enforcement entry point. With the policy off, command classification, the approval gate, the command allowlist and the hourly action budget do nothing. `workspace_only`, `forbidden_paths` and the workspace-internal boundary are not enforced either.

One check never turns off. `is_always_forbidden` blocks credential stores (`~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`) and system roots. It also rejects `..` traversal and null bytes in a path. This is the floor the module keeps whatever the configuration.

## Audit log

`audit.rs` writes an append-only stream of `AuditEvent`s under the workspace dir. Every executable tool call lands here with its `Actor` (agent or user), `Action`, `ExecutionResult` and the `SecurityContext` (autonomy level, sandbox backend and so on) it ran under. The log tells you afterwards what the agent did and why it was allowed.

## Pairing guard

`PairingGuard` (in `pairing.rs`) stands between the RPC server and any attempt to bind to a non-loopback address. `is_public_bind` detects that case. `PairingGuard` then requires a pairing token, compared in constant time with `constant_time_eq`, before the bind is allowed. The iOS and LAN-companion pairing flow relies on this to keep an unpaired peer from attaching to the desktop core.

## Secret store

`SecretStore` (implemented in `keyring/encrypted_store.rs`, re-exported through `secrets.rs`) encrypts config-field secrets with ChaCha20-Poly1305 (`enc2:` prefix) under a keychain-backed master key. It migrates the legacy XOR `enc:` format when it decrypts. Backend selection and the encrypted-file fallback are described in `crates/openhuman-core/src/security/keyring/README.md`.

## `redact()`

`redact(value)` returns a uniform 4-character-prefix string (for example `"sk-a…"`) for use in logs and error messages. Use it whenever a secret, credential, token, or PII string is about to be formatted into a `log::` / `tracing::` call. Other domains call it directly: `credentials/`, `webhooks/`, `composio/`, the integration adapters.
